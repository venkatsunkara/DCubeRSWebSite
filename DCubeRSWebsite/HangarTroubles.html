        <b>Detailed description</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The aircraft is stuck in the hanger. It is blocked by utility and service vehicles. Your objective is to clear the strip by moving the vehicles around and move the aircraft out of the hanger. The vehicles can only be moved horizontally or vertically in the direction of their orientation. You can unlock achievements as you continue to solve puzzles. There are a total of eleven achievements. All problems are solvable.

        <br />
        Based on the feedback we implemented the following in version 1.1
        <br />
        <br />
        •	In addition to horizontal drag and vertical drag, two additional touch interface gestures tap and hold are supported. Tapping on the front or rear of the vehicle will move the vehicle by one square in the direction of orientation along the end it was tapped. Tapping in the middle for a semi-truck has no impact. Pressing and holding on the front or rear of the vehicle will move it all the way till the space is available in the direction of orientation along the end it was held. <br />
        •	A Reset All feature, which will reset all the solved puzzles and achievements, if you like start all over again <br />
        •	Fixed the title name in the application with the proper ‘Hangar’ word. <br />
